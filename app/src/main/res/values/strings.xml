        Hello and welcome to the MotivateME app! <br />
        <br />
        This app is designed to let you reward yourself for working toward your goals,
        whether they be long term goals, short term goals, or just things to improve yourself. <br />
        <br />
        To use this app, navigate to activities and input activities that you would like to complete.
        Check the box when you\'ve completed that activity.<br />
        <br />
        Then, navigate to the rewards menu and input rewards and their chances.
        The way to input chances is that this app will choose a number out of the total number of chances.
        For example, if you have 2 rewards, 1 with a chance of 30 and another with a chance of 200,
        30 times out of 230 times, reward number 1 will be chosen. <br />
        <br />
        Once Rewards have been set and you\'ve completed activities, navigate to the roll page.
        In the roll page, you will be able to \"roll\" for rewards based on what you\'ve input.
        The number of times you can roll is how many activities that you\'ve completed. <br />
        <br />
        Thank you for using MotivateME! Good luck in achieving your goals!
